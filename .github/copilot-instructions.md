# Copilot instructions

Follow `AGENTS.md` at the repository root. It is the binding workflow and engineering contract for every AI assistant.

The essentials, repeated because Copilot does not import files:

- No commits, pushes, tags, merges or pull requests without the user's explicit go-ahead in the current turn. Never push to `main`; never force-push.
- Branch `type/topic` from an up-to-date `main`. Commit messages and PR titles are Conventional Commits, `type(scope): subject`. Squash merge only, after the `PR title` check passes.
- Zero third-party dependencies, public Unity APIs only, Unity floor 2022.3, public API only in `ClarityGameOptimizer.Extensions`. archify and Node.js are optional external tools, never dependencies.
- Scans never write. Fixes have a dry run, back up what they rewrite and quarantine instead of deleting. Every number names its budget.
- A `CHANGELOG.md` line under `[Unreleased]` for every user-visible change.
- Clean room: never read, decompile or copy code from proprietary plugins; build features from public Unity APIs only.
