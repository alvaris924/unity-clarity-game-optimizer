# Contributing to Clarity Game Optimizer

This document is the workflow contract for every change, whether written by hand or with an AI assistant.

## First-time setup

```
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

The hooks reject commit messages that are not Conventional Commits and refuse direct pushes to `main`. They are a courtesy check; the same rules are enforced on GitHub.

## Branching model

- `main` is always releasable and is protected: pull requests only, linear history, required checks, every review conversation resolved.
- Every change lives on a short-lived branch cut from an up-to-date `main`:
  `feat/<topic>`, `fix/<topic>`, `docs/<topic>`, `chore/<topic>`, `ci/<topic>`, `refactor/<topic>`, `perf/<topic>`, `test/<topic>`.
- One branch per issue. Branches are deleted automatically on merge.

## Issues first

- Features and bugs start as an issue using the templates. Small chores may skip the issue.
- Labels: one `area: *`, one `phase: *`, one `priority: *`, plus the kind (`bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `chore`, `performance`).
- Milestones map to releases: `v0.1.0`, `v0.5.0`, `v1.0.0`.

## Commits

- [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `type(scope): subject`.
  - Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `ci`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `revert`.
  - Scopes: `core`, `analysis`, `ui`, `settings`, `extensions`, `cli`, `export`, `tests`, `samples`, `docs`, `ci`, `release`, `deps`.
- Subject in the imperative mood, lowercase first letter, no trailing period, at most 72 characters. The body explains why, not what.
- Breaking changes: `feat(extensions)!: ...` plus a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.

## Pull requests

- Target `main` and fill in the template. Keep it a draft while work is in progress.
- The PR title must itself be a valid Conventional Commit; the `PR title` check enforces it and the squash merge uses it as the commit subject with the PR body as the message.
- Link the issue with `Closes #123`.
- Before requesting review: self-review the diff, run the EditMode tests locally, add a `CHANGELOG.md` line under `[Unreleased]` (or apply `skip-changelog`), and update docs if behaviour changed.
- Squash merge only. Never merge with a failing check.

## Changelog

[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Every user-visible change adds a line under `[Unreleased]` in one of Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security.

## Releases

- [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). `MAJOR` for breaking changes to the public `ClarityGameOptimizer.Extensions` API, to the `report.json` shape or to settings files, `MINOR` for features, `PATCH` for fixes.
- A release PR titled `chore(release): vX.Y.Z` bumps `package.json`, turns `[Unreleased]` into a dated section and updates the comparison links.
- After it merges, tag `vX.Y.Z` on `main`. The release workflow checks that the tag matches `package.json` and publishes a GitHub Release with that changelog section. OpenUPM picks the tag up automatically.

## Code standards

- Unity floor is the `unity` field in `package.json` (`2022.3`). Newer APIs go behind version defines and are exercised by the CI matrix.
- Zero third-party dependencies in the package. Optional integrations only through asmdef version defines. archify and Node.js are optional external tools, located by path at run time.
- Public API lives only in `ClarityGameOptimizer.Extensions`; everything else is `internal`.
- Logic in `ClarityGameOptimizer.Core` ships with EditMode tests. Fixtures are real build reports, asmdef sets and archify schema files.
- Scans are read-only. Fixes have a dry run, back up what they rewrite, and quarantine instead of deleting.
- Every number names its budget: download size, runtime RAM, frame time or iteration time. The two size budgets never share a table.
- Formatting follows `.editorconfig`: Allman braces, four spaces, LF, UTF-8 without BOM.

## Clean-room policy

Contributors must not read, decompile or copy code from proprietary or otherwise closed-source plugins, and must not reproduce their UI text, icons or documentation. Every feature is designed from public Unity APIs, Unity documentation and this project's own design notes. Feature parity with other tools is fine; copied expression is not. If you have worked on a comparable proprietary product's source, do not contribute to the feature it covers.

## Working with AI assistants

The same rules apply. Assistants never push to `main`, never force-push, and open pull requests like any other contributor. The binding instructions for every assistant are in `AGENTS.md`; `CLAUDE.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` defer to it.
